Christiana Urbano - Project Description
My final project is a mock-up of a website for a small public library.
I created a home page, an about page, a catalog search page, a calendar page, and a directions and hours page, which are populated with filler content.
Ideally, much of the content, especially events and hours, would be generated by JavaScript instead of editing the HTML directly, 
but these pages provide a skeleton that could be replaced with dynamic content.
A larger public library would likely need a calendar view of events, but I thought rows of of flexboxes looked nicer.
